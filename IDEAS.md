# Ideas

This file is used to track ideas for future development of this project.

## Snow Golems

- Make snow golems increase/decrease in size depending on how much health they have.

## Ghasts

- Make ghasts not attack you if they are really close, as this would result in certain death for them. Instead, they should fly away.

### Black Hole Ghasts

- Have projectiles circle around black hole ghasts.
- Have black hole ghasts be able to shoot their orbiting projectiles at the player.
- Have black hole ghasts pull in the player and damage them when they are in the center.
