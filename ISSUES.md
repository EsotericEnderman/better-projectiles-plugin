## Projectiles

- [X] Projectiles don't seem to damage entities the same way anymore.

## Ghasts

- [ ] Ghast fireballs don't match the size of the ghast (this problem is present with black hole ghasts and ur-ghasts).
- [ ] The game thinks that all black hole ghasts are ur-ghasts because of how only the scale is checked.
