# Issues

This file is used to keep track of issues with the plugin.

## WIP

### Snow Golems

- Snow golems will not regenerate after server restart.
- Snow golem health regeneration is NOT TRACKED.

### Ghasts

## Won't Fix

### Ghasts

- Ghast fireballs don't match the size of the ghast (this problem is present with black hole ghasts and ur-ghasts). - The scale of fireballs can't be changed.

## Fixed

### Projectiles

- Projectiles don't seem to damage entities the same way anymore.

### Ghasts

- The game thinks that all black hole ghasts are ur-ghasts because of how only the scale is checked.
